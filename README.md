This app is a project requested by Udacity to conclude Android Developer Nanodegree.


INSTRUCTIONS

This app uses TheMovieDB API to fetch data from the web.
To use the app on your own, you will need to:
- Create an account on https://www.themoviedb.org;
- Request an API key;
- Within Utility class, replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your own API key;
- Run.


PROJECT OVERVIEW

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. 
In this project, I built an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 
The development of this app is split in two stages. This app is stage 1. In this stage built the core experience of movies app.


THIS APP WILL:

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date


WHY THIS PROJECT?

To become an Android developer, we must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. 
Specifically, we need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. 

By building this app, I will demonstrate my understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. 
The app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.
